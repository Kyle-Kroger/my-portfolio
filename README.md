# My Developer Portfolio

Welcome to my developer portfolio! This repository is a showcase of my work as a software developer. I've built this portfolio using React with next.js, allowing me to experiment with various ideas and technologies. As a result, this portfolio is constantly evolving and reflects my journey as I explore new concepts, languages, and tools. This is the second major iteration.

Feel free to explore the projects within and get a glimpse of my journey as a software developer. Your feedback and suggestions are always welcome!
